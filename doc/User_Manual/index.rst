User Manual
***********



The Topographica user manual gives an overview of Topographica's
structure and explains importaing concepts and features from a user
perspective. This information complements the complete and detailed
component-level information in the reference manual, as well as the
step-by-step explanations in the tutorials.

Please note that the user manual is not a complete reference to all
available functionality, so that we can focus on the main ideas. If
there is a topic that you would like to see covered in the user
manual, please contact us or contribute an initial sketch of that
section.
