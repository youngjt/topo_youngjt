********************************************
Overview of Topographica design and features
********************************************

This section will first give an overview of the parts that make up
Topographica, and will then give a guide on how to choose a subset
of them for use in any particular model.

.. _class-hierarchies:

Major Topographica object types
-------------------------------

In this section, we outline the basic hierarchies of object types
used by Topographica. All of these are available to the user when
designing a model, but as the :ref:`later section
<implementation-levels>` indicates, not all of
them need to be used for any particular model, and anything not used
can be ignored. These lists are only representative of the object
types available in each general class; see the `reference manual`_
entry for each base class (which is typically hyperlinked below),
the menus in the GUI `model editor`_, or the files in topo/\*/ to
see the full list of the ones available.

In each section, the relationships between the different classes are
shown as an inheritance diagram, in outline format. As an example,
the indentation in this diagram:

-  Animal

   -  Dog

      -  Collie
      -  Terrier

indicates that a Dog is a type of Animal, and that Collies and
Terriers are both types of Dog (and thus also types of Animals). All
Collies are Dogs, and all Collies are Animals, but not all Dogs are
Collies, and not all Animals are necessarily Dogs. These
relationships show how the classes fit together; e.g., anything in
Topographica that requires an object of type Animal will accept a
Collie or a Terrier as well, plus any user-defined object of type
Dog.

Parameterized objects and Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Parameterized`_
-  `Parameter`_

   -  `Number`_

      -  `Integer`_

   -  `Boolean`_
   -  `Callable`_
   -  `ClassSelector`_

In Python, any object can have *attributes*, which consist of a name
and a value (of any type). Topographica provides an extended version
of attributes called `Parameter`_\ s, which have their own
documentation, range and type error checking, and mechanisms for
inheritance of default values. These features are provided for any
`Parameterized`_ object, which is a Python object extended to
support `Parameter`_\ s. Most Topographica objects are
`Parameterized`_. `Parameters`_ are discussed in more detail on a
separate page.

Simulation and Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Simulation`_
-  `Event`_
-  `EventProcessor`_

   -  `Sheet`_: (see below)

The set of objects to be simulated is kept by the `Simulation`_
class, which keeps track of the current simulator time along with
`Event`_\ s that are currently occurring or are scheduled to occur
in the future. The objects in the simulation are of type
`EventProcessor`_, which simply means that they can process events.
Events and EventProcessors are both very general concepts, because
the Simulation must be able to include any possible process that
could be relevant for a model.

Sheets
~~~~~~

-  `Sheet`_

   -  `ProjectionSheet`_ Sheet that can calculate activity based on
      a set of `Projection`_\ s.

      -  `CFSheet`_ ProjectionSheet whose Projections are of type
         `CFProjection`_, which means that they are made up of
         `ConnectionField`_\ s (below). This Sheet type supports a
         large class of topographic map models as-is, but others
         need specific extensions.

         -  `LISSOM`_: CFSheet with extensions to support the LISSOM
            algorithm.
         -  `SaccadeController`_: CFSheet with extensions to support
            saccades.

The actual EventProcessors in most current Topographica simulations
are typically of type `Sheet`_. A Sheet is a specific type of
EventProcessor that occupies a finite 2D region of the continuous
plane, allows indexing of this region using floating point
coordinates, and maintains a rectangular array of activity values
covering this region.

Connections and Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `EPConnection`_

   -  `Projection`_

      -  `CFProjection`_

         -  `SharedWeightCFProjection`_

EventProcessors can be connected together with unidirectional links
called `EPConnection`_\ s. These connections provide a persistent
mechanism for data generated by one EventProcessor to be delivered
to another one after some nonzero delay in simulation time.

Most connections between Sheets are of type `Projection`_, which can
be thought of as a bulk set of connections that includes many
individual connections between neural units. More specifically, a
Projection is a Connection that can produce an Activity matrix when
given an input Activity matrix, which will typically be used by the
destination Sheet when it computes its activation. In the GUI, the
Projection activity can be visualized just as Sheet activity is,
though the Sheet activity is considered the actual response of each
unit. (The Projection activity is just a handy way of computing and
reasoning about the contribution of each Projection to this overall
Sheet activity.)

One specific type of Projection currently implemented is
`CFProjection`_, i.e. a Projection that consists of a set of
`ConnectionField`_ objects, each of which contains the connections
to one unit in the destination CFSheet. CFProjection is very
general, and with appropriate parameters can implement either
spatially restricted localized CFs, all-to-all projections (using a
nominal\_bounds\_template BoundingBox with a radius larger than the
source Sheet), or one-to-one projections (using a
nominal\_bounds\_template sized to cover only a single unit on the
source Sheet). A special type of CFProjection,
`SharedWeightCFProjection`_ is used to perform the mathematical
operation of convolution, i.e., applying a set of weights to all
points in a plane, and is equivalent to having one ConnectionField
shared by every destination neuron.

PatternGenerators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `PatternGenerator`_

   -  `Gaussian`_
   -  `Constant`_
   -  `UniformRandom`_

A large family of flexible, general-purpose function objects for
producing 2D patterns is provided, as described on :doc:`the Patterns page
<patterns>`.

Transfer functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `TransferFn`_

   -  `DivisiveNormalizeL1`_
   -  `DivisiveNormalizeL2`_
   -  `PiecewiseLinear`_
   -  `PatternCombine`_
   -  `IdentityTF`_

-  `CFPOutputFn`_

   -  `CFPOF\_Plugin`_
   -  `CFPOF\_DivisiveNormalizeL1`_

A TransferFn is a function object that will accept a matrix argument
and (typically) modify it in some way. This is a very simple
concept, but it is used many times throughout the Topographica code,
and provides a lot of flexibility. Any function that can normalize a
set of weights or an input pattern is a TransferFn, as is any
Sheet's activity transfer function.

TransferFns are controlled by a set of parameters that are each
typically called output\_fns. Each such parameter is associated with
a particular processing step of a Sheet or a Projection. For
instance, CFProjections have output\_fns applied after they
calculate their activity, and weights\_output\_fns applied after a
set of weights is modified. Sheets have output\_fns applied after
they calculate their activity, and PatternGenerators have
output\_fns applied after the pattern is calculated.

The output\_fns parameters allow the user to control calculations in
a flexible way, without having to write or maintain new code. For
instance, the PatternCombine TransferFn can be used to add a
user-specified type of random noise to any of the major processing
steps. Alternatively, it can be used to mask out a specific region
at the end of the calculation, to implement a user-specified lesion
or a non-rectangular neural region.

Multiple TransferFns can be applied in series, e.g. to add random
noise, normalize the results, and then mask out lesioned units.

For the common and very expensive case of normalizing
ConnectionField weights, a family of transfer functions that works
on an entire CFProjection at once is also available (CFPOutputFn).
These functions can be optimized heavily, and can do such things as
normalizing across an entire Projection.

Response functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `ResponseFn`_

   -  `DotProduct`_

-  `CFPResponseFn`_

   -  `CFPRF\_Plugin`_
   -  `CFPRF\_DotProduct`_
   -  `CFPRF\_EuclideanDistance`_

A ResponseFn is a function object that will compute a matrix of
activity values from a matrix of weights and an input matrix of the
same shape. This is typically used for a neural response function.

A family of response functions that works on an entire CFProjection
at once is also available (CFPResponseFn). These functions can be
optimized heavily, and can do such things as normalizing across an
entire Sheet.

Learning functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `LearningFn`_

   -  `Hebbian`_
   -  `Oja`_
   -  `Covariance`_

-  `CFPLearningFn`_

   -  `CFPLF\_Plugin`_
   -  `CFPLF\_Hebbian`_
   -  `CFPLF\_HebbianSOM`_

A LearningFn is a function object that will modify a matrix of
weight values given an input activity pattern and an output activity
value. Most such rules are Hebbian-based, i.e., driven by the
product of the input and output activity values, but there are many
variants.

A family of learning functions that works on an entire CFProjection
at once is also available (CFPLearningFn). These functions can be
optimized heavily, and can do such things as basing the activity on
the single best-responding unit in a Sheet (as in a Kohonen SOM).

Who should use Topographica?
----------------------------

Topographica's main target audience is computational neuroscientists
who want to simulate large, topographically mapped brain regions.
Many such researchers initially start coding with general-purpose
languages like Matlab or bare Python, because it is relatively
straightforward to specify an initial fully-connected model with
square connections and hard-coded sizes from scratch. However, as
soon as the model becomes more complex, the code quickly becomes
unwieldy. Supporting local rather than full connectivity, circular
or arbitrary connection patterns rather than rectangular arrays,
variable densities of neurons per region rather than hard-coded
ones, arbitrary patterns of connectivity (including feedforward and
feedback connections) between sheets rather than feedforward
connections only, --- all of these will quickly make code be
unreadable and unmaintainable without a clear, clean overall design.
Topographica's developers have dealt with these cases already, and
the result is highly robust and reliable, making it very
straightforward to run a large class of models without complicated
coding or debugging.

.. _implementation-levels:

How much of Topographica to use
-------------------------------

Topographica is designed as an extensible framework or toolkit,
rather than as a monolithic application with a fixed list of
features. Users can extend its functionality by writing objects in
Python, which is a fully general-purpose interpreted programming
language. As a result, Topographica supports any possible model (and
indeed, any possible software program), but as the above lists
suggest, it provides much more specific support for specific types
of models of topographic maps. This approach allows some models to
be built without any programming, while not limiting the future
directions of research.

The following list explains the different levels of support provided
by Topographica for different types of models, depending on which
parts of Topographica you are able to use. The list is ordered so
that the most general support, suitable for everyone but requiring
the most user effort, is at the top, and the most specific support
is at the bottom. Note that everything in the levels below where
your model fits in can be ignored, because those files can be
deleted with no ill effects unless some part of your model uses
objects from those levels. You can also add items to any level,
i.e., to any class hierarchy listed above; please `contact us`_ to
contribute any of these to the project or to join as a developer.

Topographica levels:

#. Python with C interface (ignoring *everything* in topo/):

   Supports:
    Anything is possible, with no performance or programming
    limitations (since anything can be written efficiently in C, and
    the rest can be written in Python).
   Limitations:
    Need to do all programming yourself. Can't mix and match code
    with other researchers very easily, because they are unlikely to
    CHoose similar interfaces or make similar assumptions.
#. Everything in 1., plus event-driven simulator with
   parameterizable objects, debugging output, etc. (using just
   simulation.py from topo/base/ in addition to Parameter support
   from the Param package):

   Supports:
    Running simulations of any physical system, with good semantics
    for object parameter specification with inheritance.
   Limitations:
    Basic event structure is in Python, which is good for generality
    but means that performance will be good only if the computation
    in the individual events is big compared to the number of events.
    This assumption is true for existing Topographica simulations,
    but may not apply to all systems being modelled.
#. Everything in 1.-2., plus Sheets (adding topo/base/sheet.py and
   its dependencies)
   
   Supports:
    Uniform interface for a wide variety of brain models of
    topographically organized 2D regions. E.g. can measure preference
    maps for anything supporting the Sheet interface, and can do
    plotting for them uniformly.
   Limitations:
    Not useful if the assumptions of what constitutes a Sheet do not
    apply to your model -- e.g. ignores curvature, sulci, gyrii; has
    hard boundaries between regions, uses Cartesian, not hexagonal
    grid. For instance, Sheets are not a good way to model how the
    entire brain is parcellated into brain areas during development,
    because that happens in 3D and does not start out with very
    strict boundaries between regions.
#. Everything in 1.-3., plus Projections and ConnectionFields
   (adding the rest of topo/base/)

   Supports:
    Anything with topographically organized projections between
    Sheets, each of which contains an array of units, each unit
    having input from a spatially restricted region on another (or
    the same) sheet. Any such sheet can be plotted and analyzed
    uniformly.
   Limitations:
    Much more specific limitations on what types of models can be
    used -- e.g. broad, sparse connectivity between regions is less
    well supported (so far), and non-topographic mappings are
    currently left out.
#. Everything in 1.-4., plus the Topographica primitives library
   (the rest of topo/)
   
   Supports:
    Can implement a large range of map models without coding any new
    objects -- instead setting parameters and calling methods on
    existing objects. Easy to mix and match components between
    models, and to add just a few new components for a new but
    similar model. Easy to compare different models from this class
    under identical conditions.
   Limitations:
    Only a relatively small set of components has actually been
    implemented so far, and so in practice the primitives library
    will need to be expanded to cover most new models, even from the
    class of models described in 4.

As one moves down this list, the amount of programming required to
implement a basic model decreases (down to zero if you use only the
primitives we've already implemented), but the limitations governing
what can be done at that level increase. To the extent that these
limitations are appropriate for what you want to model, Topographica
will be an appropriate tool. If what you want to do conflicts with
these limitations, you will have to go up to higher levels in this
list, doing more of the implementation work yourself and gaining
less from what the Topographica developers have done. If everything
you are doing ends up being implemented at level 1 above, then there
is probably no reason to use Topographica at all, except perhaps as
an example of how to use Python and C together with various external
libraries.

Note that different parts of any particular model may be implemented
at different levels from this list. For instance, even for a model
that is fully supported by the Topographica primitives in level 5,
you may want to add an interface to a custom-built external hardware
device, which would have to be implemented at level 1. Data from the
device would then presumably appear in a form compatible with one of
the lower layers 3-5, and could then be used with the other
Topographica primitives.
