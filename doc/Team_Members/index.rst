Topographica is developed by a distributed team of researchers in
the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe, most recently
including:

`James A. Bednar`_, Lead author and project manager, 2002 -
 Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. Parts of
 Topographica were inspired by Jim's C++ `LISSOM`_ simulator in use
 from 1995-2004, but Topographica was entirely reimplemented in
 Python for extensibility and generality. Jim reviews all code and is
 the last word on the design and features.

`Chris Ball`_, 2005 -
 Chris was the main developer from 2005 - 2012, working on nearly
 every part of Topographica. Since January 2009 he has been a PhD
 student in Edinburgh, working on the formation of color maps in V1.

Jan Antolik, 2006 -
 Jan completed his University of Edinburgh PhD thesis in Autumn 2010,
 focusing on complex cells and surround modulation in V1. He
 continues to use Topographica in his postdoctoral work and has
 contributed a variety of related code.

Wiktor Brodlo, 2012 - 2013
 Wiktor is supervising the split of Topographica into independent
 subprojects, as part of his undergraduate project.

Boris Hristov, 2012 - 2013
 Boris is building an improved test suite for Topographica, as part
 of his undergraduate project.

Alessio Plebe, 2010 -
 Alessio teaches at the University of Messina, Italy, and contributes
 code for analyzing higher-order feature maps.

Keith Robertson, 2012 - 2013
 Keith is expanding the Tk GUI support for Topographica, focusing on
 the Model Editor, as part of his undergraduate project.

Philipp J. F. Rudiger, 2011 -
 Philipp completed his MSc degree at the University of Edinburgh,
 working on RF measurement protocols for two-photon Calcium imaging
 in ferrets and is now pursuing his PhD on feedback, attention and
 contextual processing in V1 using Topographica models.

Jean-Luc Stevens, 2011 -
 Jean-Luc received an MSc degree from the University of Edinburgh
 (project: A temporal model of neural activity and VSD response in
 the primary visual cortex) and is now a PhD student in Edinburgh
 working on temporal processing in V1 using Topographica models.
