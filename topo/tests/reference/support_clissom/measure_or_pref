### Arguments

# These will keep the value last set; they are not overwritten like arguments usually are
define_param measure_or_pref::histograms        Param_Integer False True \
"Whether to use OrientationPreference as the axis for activity and other\n\
histograms.  This parameter should probably be replaced with the name\n\
of the map to use for such purposes, so that e.g. OcularPreference could\n\
be used instead." \
False

define_param measure_or_pref::or_num_angles     Param_Integer 0 -1 \
"The number of angles to use in measure_or_pref.  The angles are generally\n\
chosen at regular intervals in the range [0,PI] radians." \
4
  
define_param measure_or_pref::save_images       Param_Integer 0 -1 \
"Use nonzero values for debugging only -- if nonzero, plots some or all of\n\
the images used when calculating orientation preferences.  If set to 1,\n\
every such image will be saved, which for some settings of or_num_angles,\n\
sp_num_frequencies, and sp_num_phases will generate a huge number of images.\n\
Often you will rather want to set this parameter to some higher value, e.g. 10,\n\
so that only images from every 10th angle (for example) will be saved.  Since\n\
these images would normally be used to make sure that the spatial frequencies\n\
are reasonable (given that angles and phases are straightforward), you may want\n\
(also or instead) to reduce or_num_angles and sp_num_phases to correspondingly\n\
reduce the number of images generated." \
0

define_param measure_or_pref::sp_min_frequency  Param_String 0 -1 \
"The minimum spatial frequency to use in measure_or_pref.  The scale of this\n\
parameter is relative to the anatomical RF width (2*rf_radius+1) and (inversely)\n\
to the area of the retina, so it's simplest to consider it an arbitrary relative\n\
scale for any given network.  The default is suitable when sp_num_frequencies\n\
is 1, but when more frequencies are used you may wish to start with a lower\n\
value to cover a wider range, instead of having only medium and high\n\
frequencies." \
10

define_param measure_or_pref::sp_num_frequencies Param_Integer 0 -1 \
"The number of spatial frequencies to use in measure_or_pref.  The frequencies\n\
range from sp_min_frequency to sp_num_frequencies*sp_min_frequency.  The\n\
intermediate frequencies are chosen using the formula sp_min_frequency * \n\
sp_num_frequencies/n, where n is an integer from 1 to sp_num_frequencies,\n\
and thus the spacing is nonlinear (by design)." \
0

define_param measure_or_pref::sp_num_phases     Param_Integer 0 -1 \
"The number of different spatial phases (i.e. positions) to use in\n\
measure_or_pref.  Unless you supply some other specific ValueGenerator, the\n\
retina is divided evenly by this number, and each of the resulting positions\n\
is used; otherwise sp_num_phases are chosen at random from across the\n\
retina. The Nyquist minimum to avoid aliasing depends on the frequency,\n\
with an upper limit of RN*2 but lower values for typical frequencies." \
BaseRN*0.75


# Normal arguments
define_param measure_or_pref::drawing_command    Param_String 0 -1 \
"For the default measure_or_pref::input_command, the command to use to draw\n\
each pattern."

define_param measure_or_pref::input_present_options    Param_String 0 -1 \
"For the default measure_or_pref::input_command, optional set of arguments to\n\
pass to input_present.  Any of the named arguments accepted by input_present\n\
may be used, and they override the values in measure_or_pref::input_command.  For\n\
instance, one can enable settling ('activate=True settle=True'), etc."

define_param measure_or_pref::input_command    Param_String 0 -1 \
"The command to call at each iteration of measure_or_pref; usually\n\
input_present_object or a variant."

define_param measure_or_pref::freq_factor      Param_String 0 -1  \
"Factor to be divided by the spatial frequency magnitude to get the actual\n\
spatial frequency for use in measure_or_pref.  The default formula will result\n\
in a frequency that decreases towards sp_min_frequency in divisive steps."

define_param measure_or_pref::weighted_average  Param_Boolean False True \
"Whether to use the weighted average method of computing an orientation map.\n\
See measure_stimulus_map for more details."

define_param measure_or_pref::force_eye         Param_Integer -1 MaxInt \
"If non-negative, specifies the number of the eye in which to present stimuli,\n\
as an integer less than num_eyes.  If negative (the default), inputs are\n\
presented alternately in each eye, and orientation of the pattern (in any eye)\n\
causing the highest response is taken as the preferred orientation."\
-1

define_param measure_or_pref::od_num_levels Param_Integer 0 -1 \
"The total number of different values of Ocular-ity to use during\n\
measure_or_pref.  The default is 1 if force_eyes is true, and\n\
num_eyes otherwise.  As long as num_eyes correctly reports the number\n\
of eyes, there should not be any need to change this parameter." \
num_eyes

define_param measure_or_pref::eye_guard Param_String -1 -1 \
"Expression used to determine if the stimulus should be present for the\n\
input_current_eye." \
""
