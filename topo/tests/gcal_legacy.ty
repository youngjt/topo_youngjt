Model equivalent to examples/gcal.ty before moving to class-based
approach. This version of the GCAL model does not use controlled
random streams (i.e. time_dependent=False).

This script is used to test against gcal_legacy.ty_DATA. This was the
original training test data for the GCAL model (the first version of
gcal.ty_DATA).
